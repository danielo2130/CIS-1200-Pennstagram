Overview:
  Pennstagram is a Java-based image processing application that allows users to apply various photo manipulations through a GUI interface. 
  This project combines principles of object-oriented programming, data structures, and image processing.

Key Features:
  Implemented custom image transformations by manipulating 2D arrays of Pixel objects representing RGB values.

Transformations Built from Scratch:
  Color Manipulation: Grayscale (average/luminosity), color inversion, color scaling, alpha blending
  Geometric Manipulations: 90Â° rotation (clockwise and counter-clockwise), image bordering
  Advanced Effects: Contrast adjustment, color palette reduction using frequency mapping, and Gaussian-style blur using box blur logic

Class Design & Testing:
  Developed and tested a custom immutable Pixel class with encapsulated color data.
  Wrote unit tests in JUnit to validate pixel transformations and image operations.
  Employed encapsulation and defensive copying to prevent side effects in pixel handling.

Tools & Languages:
  Java
  JUnit for Testing
  Custom GUI Framework (provided by course staff)
  Codio IDE
